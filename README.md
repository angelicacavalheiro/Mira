# Mira
## About this Project
Mira is an API that makes it possible to manage an e-commerce that sells art from different galleries.

## Why
My project partner and I realized that many people who love art don't know where to buy it. That's why we created this e-commerce.

We'll be happy if you can provide some feedback on the design, code, structure, or anything else you can report that might make us a better developer!

## Database Layout
<img src="./public/database.png" alt="Database Layout" />
The database was designed at https://www.dbdesigner.net/ for PostgreSQL. <br/>

In your psql terminal
```
$ CREATE DATABASE mira_dev;
```
Access the database
```
$ \c mira_dev
```
Now, just run the commands listed in <a href="https://github.com/angelicacavalheiro/Mira">dump.sql</a>

## How it works
This project is divided into two parts:
1. Backend (This repository)
2. Frontend (You can find here: https://github.com/digdiego13/Mira_front)

## Some notes about this app
1 - We are still refactoring this project, so the architecture of some components may be different from other components.

2 - The address and payment features have been simplified in this project. So to use this API in real situations, these features need to be improved.
